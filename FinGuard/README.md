| **Feature**               | **Description**                                                            |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transaction Details       | Transaction ID, timestamp, amount (USD), transaction type                 |
| Sender Information        | Sender ID, account, country, sector, line of business                     |
| Beneficiary Information   | Beneficiary ID, account, country                                          |
| Target Variable           | Label (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraudulent)                                    |

## Key Insights  

### Data Analysis Findings  
- **Class Imbalance**: Only 2.06% of transactions are fraudulent, requiring specialized handling techniques  
- **Geographic Patterns**: USA dominates both sender and beneficiary countries in transactions  
- **Entity Involvement**: JPMC-CLIENT entities are most commonly involved in fraudulent transactions  
- **Transaction Types**: Multiple types including QUICK-PAYMENT, DEPOSIT-CASH, PAY-CHECK, WITHDRAWAL  
- **Amount Distribution**: Both USD amount and sender sector follow non-normal distributions  

### Model Performance  
The system implements and compares multiple machine learning algorithms:
- **Random Forest**: Best overall performance with ensemble learning  
- **LightGBM**: Efficient gradient boosting with high accuracy  
- **XGBoost**: Robust performance with advanced regularization  
- **Logistic Regression**: Fast linear baseline model  
- **SVM**: Alternative classification approach  

All models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.
